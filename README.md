# Pexeso - Memory Game

## Code Institute MS2 Project in Interactive Frontend Development

## About

This is a simple Memory Game Web Application created for my second Milestone project with Code Institute. The game is designed to test a user's memory and is made up of a deck of cards, each card containing an image assigned randomly. The goal is to click on a card to reveal the image behind it, memorise the card containing that image and match cards with similar images until all pairs are matched.

## What is the goal of this challenge.

The goal of this challenge is to match all the cards in as little time as possible, making the fewest selections possible.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

In the construction of this project I have utilised the following languages, frameworks, libraries and tools:

* **HTML**, **CSS** and **Java Script** programming languages.

* [Bootstrap v5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
* The project used Bootstrap to simplify the website layout by integrating the Modals for further artist info and the Cards for event listings and company info.
  Also to provide overall responsive behaviour on all devices.

* [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
* I used **GitPod** as the development environment for my website. I also used Git for Version Control in the project.  

* [GiHub](https://github.com/)
* The project used **GitHub** to host my code that was created and pushed from GitPod.

* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
* I used **Balsamiq**, the rapid low-fidelity UI wireframing tool during the prototyping phase to structure the website and its content following best UX practices.

* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
* **Chrome Dev Tools** was used to consistently test the site and run reports from Lighthouse.



## TESTING

**UX STORIES TESTING**


**VALIDATION**

I used the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the [Markup and W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check the CSS validity of the site.

![htmlvalidator]

After fixing the errors on both testing sites, the site eventually passed the W3C Validation.

![htmlvalidatorFinal]

Fix Markup and W3C CSS Validation Service.

* The [Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/) was used to test for colour contrast on the project.

Add another contast.


* I constantly tested the code in [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/) and often ran Lighthouse audits to identify and fix issues that affected the site's performance, accessibility and user experience.


After fixing the errors in the lighthouse.



In order to have optimal user experience, the site needs to be accessible. I would continually run the URL through WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool to highlight potential issues. I continued until no further errors were given.
